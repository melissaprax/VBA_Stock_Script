# Stock Year-to-Year Script

This script was written to find the changes in stocks from year-to-year.

## Description

Using Excel and VBA, I wrote a script to find several changes in stocks annually.

Expected outputs in the corresponding Excel worksheets include:

1. The ticker symbols in a new column

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year in a new column. This column is also color coordinated with red or green accordingly.

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year in a new column.

4. Greatest % increase and corresponding ticker symbol in a new column.

5. Greatest % decrease and corresponding ticker symbol in a new column.

6. Greatest total volume and corresponding ticker symbol in a new column.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
